# 🚀 Landing Craft

**SDD, but for landing pages.** A phased, multi-agent workflow that ships a modern, elegant,
intuitive, **high-converting** landing — one that does *not* look AI-generated.

You say *"armame una landing para X"*. It **asks the few questions it needs**, then autonomously
runs strategy → copy → design → build → motion → polish → SEO → review — and **deploys it** (GitHub
+ Vercel). It doesn't call it done until it **looks crafted, sells, and is live.**

## Install

**One command** (macOS / Linux):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/propiter/landing-craft/main/install.sh | bash
```

**Or as a Claude Code plugin:**

```bash
/plugin marketplace add propiter/landing-craft
/plugin install landing-craft@landing-craft
```

The installer copies one skill, 9 sub-agents, and 5 slash-commands into `~/.claude/`. No sudo, no
global npm, nothing runs in the background. Re-run anytime to update.

## Use it

```bash
/landing "una landing para mi SaaS de facturación"       # ★ flagship: asks → builds → DEPLOYS (live URL)
/landing-new "API de facturación DIAN para developers"   # planning only → review the plan
/landing-build                                            # build + motion + polish + SEO
/landing-review                                           # render @ 390/768/1440, score, fix
/landing-ship "<your product>"                            # full auto (no deploy)
```

You don't need to know marketing — that's the strategy agent's job. With **`/landing`** you don't
even need a brief: it asks the few questions it needs, builds autonomously, and hands you a live
URL (it installs the Vercel CLI if missing and guides the one-time login).

## The pipeline

```
  intake ─► strategy ─┬─► copy ───┐
   (ASK)              └─► design ──┴─► build ─► motion ─► polish ─┐
                                            build ─► seo ─────────┴─► review ⭯ ─► deploy
```

| # | Phase | Sub-agent | What it guarantees |
|---|-------|-----------|--------------------|
| 0 | Intake | *orchestrator* | Asks the few questions that change the output — never builds blind |
| 1 | Strategy | `landing-strategy` | Positioning, ICP, core promise, offer — the foundation |
| 2 | Copy | `landing-copy` | Anti-slop conversion copy; the 5-second test passes |
| 3 | Design | `landing-design` | A deliberate visual system — the anti-"made with AI" phase |
| 4 | Build | `landing-build` | Real code (Next.js + Tailwind by default), mobile-first, accessible |
| 5 | Motion | `landing-motion` | One hero reveal + micro-interactions, 60fps, reduced-motion safe |
| 6 | Polish | `landing-polish` | The craft pass — type, spacing, contrast, responsive, states |
| 7 | SEO | `landing-seo` | Meta, OG, JSON-LD, Core Web Vitals, `llms.txt` |
| 8 | Review | `landing-review` | Renders & scores craft + conversion; loops until it passes |
| 9 | Deploy | `landing-deploy` | Pushes to GitHub + deploys to Vercel; installs the CLI & guides first-time login |

## The four bars (enforced every phase)

> 1. It does **NOT look AI-generated**.  2. It **sells** (what/who/why/next in 5 seconds).
> 3. It's **intuitive** (one obvious action per screen).  4. It's **crafted** (real motion, type,
> contrast, speed, a11y).

If any bar fails, it isn't done.

## Animation depth — you pick, it remembers

Not flat, not chaotic — a **dial**. Default **medium**; ask for `menos` or `más` and it adjusts (and
remembers your preference for next time):

- **subtle** — hero reveal, scroll fades, button micro-interactions.
- **medium** *(default)* — + Lenis smooth scroll, section reveals, **card hover depth**, number counters, CTA glow.
- **rich** — + GSAP scroll-scrub/parallax, magnetic buttons, 3D-tilt cards, spotlight/beams (Aceternity / Magic UI).

Built on **Motion + GSAP (free) + Lenis**, Next.js + Tailwind, every level `prefers-reduced-motion` safe.

## Built on a stack, not from scratch

Landing Craft is the **orchestrator**. The deep knowledge lives in skills it composes — install
those for the full effect:

- [`motion-craft`](https://github.com/propiter/motion-craft) — animation
- `marketing-strategy` · `brand-voice` · `seo-geo` · `design-review-loop` — strategy, copy, SEO, review
- [Impeccable](https://github.com/pbakaus/impeccable) — the aesthetic engine
