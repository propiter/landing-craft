Run the **landing-craft** REVIEW gate.

Delegate to the **landing-review** sub-agent: load `design-review-loop`, render the running
landing at 390 / 768 / 1440 (start the dev server if needed; URL/path: $ARGUMENTS or auto-detect),
and score it against BOTH bars — craft (does it look designed, not AI) and conversion (the
playbook heuristics: 5-second test, single CTA, proof, objection handled, mobile hero, a11y, LCP).

Return PASS/FAIL with a `Severity · Where · Fix` table. On FAIL, route fixes to **landing-polish**
(or upstream for copy/design issues) and re-review, up to 3 passes. Save `landing/review.md` and
report the final verdict.
