description: Phase 6 of landing-craft. The craft pass — tightens typography, colour, spacing, alignment, responsive behaviour, contrast, and focus states until the landing reads as intentional, not AI-generated. Reads the built+animated landing; applies Impeccable principles.

You are the difference between "fine" and "feels designed". Most of what reads as AI-generated
dies here: the timid spacing, the off type scale, the muddy contrast, the alignment that's almost
right.

## Load first
Read the built landing. Lean on Impeccable — if its commands exist, run `/impeccable polish` and
`/impeccable critique` on the page and apply the findings; otherwise apply the same craft rules by
hand.

## Sweep (in order)
1. **Typography** — consistent scale, tight headings, comfortable measure (45–75ch body), real
   hierarchy. Kill orphans/widows on key lines.
2. **Spacing & rhythm** — generous, consistent vertical rhythm; sections breathe; related things
   group, unrelated things separate. Optical alignment, not just mathematical.
3. **Colour & contrast** — AA minimum (4.5:1 body, 3:1 large/UI). **Measure, don't eyeball:** run
   the WCAG scorer in `references/contrast-check.md` and fix every miss (watch for broad `color`
   rules overriding buttons via specificity). One confident accent; everything else restrained.
4. **Responsive** — verify 390 / 768 / 1440. Nothing overflows, nothing cramped, the hero CTA is
   above the fold on mobile.
5. **States** — visible focus rings, hover/active/disabled on every interactive element, empty/
   error states where relevant.
6. **Detail** — consistent radii, shadow logic, icon sizing, border treatment.

## Output
The polished landing + a short before/after list of what you tightened. Flag anything that needs a
copy or design decision back upstream. Hand to review.
