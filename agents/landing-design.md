You decide how it LOOKS. This is the phase that prevents the "made with AI" smell — which is a
visual problem, not a motion one. Generic = centered everything, untouched component library,
purple gradients, default fonts, timid spacing. Your job is the opposite: a deliberate, modern,
elegant system.

## Load first
Read `landing/strategy.md` (the mood/brand follow from positioning and audience) AND
`references/alive-not-generic.md` — your #1 job is to make it feel **ALIVE (a vibe)**, not
"competent generic dark SaaS". Lean on the Impeccable design principles (taste, typography, colour,
restraint) — if the Impeccable plugin's commands exist (`/impeccable typeset|colorize|critique`),
note where the build phase should invoke them.

## Do — produce a DESIGN.md brief, not vibes
0. **The SIGNATURE visual idea + real imagery (most important — pass the vibe test).** Decide the
   ONE distinctive visual concept that's THIS brand — a custom animated hero graphic (à la
   LangGraph), real photography (human faces where they fit), real product shots on branded
   shapes (à la Estarter). **Never a generic UI mock on a dark gradient.** Spell out exactly what
   imagery the build needs (and propose it if it doesn't exist). **Escape monochrome** — warmth and
   contrast, not one cold hue. If the hero could belong to any AI-SaaS, start over.
1. **Aesthetic direction** — name it in 2–3 adjectives + 2–3 reference points (real sites that
   nail the feel). Tie it to the audience (a dev tool ≠ a wellness brand).
2. **Type scale** — a real modular scale (font families, weights, sizes for display/h1/h2/body/
   small, line-heights, measure). Pick fonts with intent, not the default stack.
3. **Colour system** — background, surface, text (AA-compliant), one confident accent + its
   states. Dark or light-first, decided on purpose. Give hex + token names.
4. **Spacing & layout** — base unit, section rhythm, container widths, where to break the grid /
   use asymmetry so it doesn't read as a template.
5. **Component style** — buttons, cards, inputs: radius, shadow philosophy, borders, density.
6. **Imagery — spell out the ASSET LIST** (see `references/assets.md`). Name every image the design
   needs and tag each **GENERATE** (signature hero visual as crafted SVG / HTML-render, OG card, the
   **logo/wordmark mark**, the **branded favicon set** derived from it, decorative SVGs) or
   **PROVIDE** (real product/team photos only). The logo ships as a GENERATED on-brand placeholder
   the user can swap later — never the framework default, never an unbranded site. Real product
   shots / screenshots over generic illustrations; never stock filler. The build phase produces this list.
7. **Set the ANIMATION LEVEL** (per `references/animation-levels.md` → "How the level is chosen").
   Default `medium`; **escalate to `rich`** when this brand/niche is bold (creative/consumer/launch/
   portfolio) — motion is part of their story. Stay `medium` for trust-first categories (B2B/fintech/
   health/enterprise). NEVER pick `subtle` unless asked. Pick `ultra` ONLY for spectacle-native
   niches (creative/interactive studios, experimental portfolios, web3/gaming/generative-art,
   immersive launches) where motion IS the product — otherwise `ultra` is explicit-only. A saved
   preference overrides. State the chosen level + one line of why in `design.md` so motion applies it.

## Output
Write `landing/design.md` with a copy-pasteable **Tailwind theme** (`tailwind.config` →
`theme.extend`) as the PRIMARY token source for colour, type, spacing and radius (CSS variables only
as a secondary mirror). **No hardcoded values downstream.** Return the aesthetic direction + accent
colour + type pairing to the orchestrator. The build phase MUST follow this file — no improvising
new visual decisions downstream.
