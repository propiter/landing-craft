You ship it. After review passes, your job is to get the landing live with the user doing as
little as possible — ideally nothing but opening a URL. Never run before review PASSES.

## 1. GitHub (if available)
- `gh auth status` — if authenticated, create + push a **NEW, DEDICATED repo** for this landing:
  `gh repo create <owner>/<name> --public --source=<project-root> --remote=origin --push`.
- **CRITICAL — always a fresh repo, never an existing one.** A brand's GitHub URL mentioned in the
  brief (e.g. "github.com/acme/acme") is a **reference for research, NOT a deploy target**. NEVER
  clone an existing repo and build inside it, and NEVER push the generated site into a repo that
  already has unrelated contents (above all, never the landing-craft skill's own repo). Before
  creating, check the name is free (`gh repo view <owner>/<name>` → if it EXISTS, pick a distinct
  name like `<brand>-site` / `<brand>-landing`). The generated site is its OWN standalone project —
  it must live in its OWN repo with only its own files.
- If `gh` isn't authenticated, skip and note it; don't block deploy.
- **The repo ships hardened.** Before pushing, confirm the generated project carries the CI +
  hygiene files the build phase wrote (per `references/hardening.md`): `.github/workflows/ci.yml`,
  `.github/dependabot.yml`, husky + lint-staged, `.prettierrc`. If any is missing, that's debt — flag
  it back to `landing-build` rather than shipping a repo with no CI or dependency automation. (The
  security headers themselves ship in `next.config.ts`, so they deploy automatically with the app —
  nothing extra to configure on Vercel.)

## 2. Vercel — install if missing, auth via DEVICE FLOW (no terminal for the user), then deploy

The user must NEVER have to run a terminal command. You drive everything; the user only opens a
browser link when authentication is genuinely required.

1. **Detect:** `vercel --version`. If missing, **install it**: `npm i -g vercel`.
2. **Auth (one time only):** `vercel whoami`. If it returns a username, you're already authed →
   skip straight to deploy (this is the "after the first time, fully automatic" case).
   If NOT authed:
   - Run **`vercel login` in the BACKGROUND**. It **auto-opens the user's default browser** to the
     device-approval page with the code pre-filled — they just click *Approve*. It then blocks on
     "Waiting for authentication...".
   - Tell the user simply: *"Se abrió tu navegador para autorizar Vercel — aprobá ahí y listo."*
     ONLY if the browser did not open, give the printed `Visit https://…/oauth/device?user_code=XXXX`
     link as a FALLBACK. Do NOT instruct them to open/paste the link by hand — opening it manually
     can prompt for the code instead of auto-filling it; the auto-opened tab is the one that works.
   - The background process completes the instant they approve. Poll `vercel whoami` until it
     returns a user; the session then persists forever (every future deploy is fully automatic).
3. **Deploy** from the build dir (static → folder with `index.html`; Next.js → project root):
   - **Name the project** sensibly from the brief (e.g. `acme-landing`). Create it FIRST —
     `vercel project add <name>` — because `--project` needs an existing project. Then:
     `vercel deploy --yes --cwd <build-dir> --project <name>`.
   - Promote with `vercel --prod` ONLY on approval.
   - **Hand the user the PUBLIC URL = the project's production `*.vercel.app` alias** (e.g.
     `<project>-<suffix>.vercel.app`), NOT the deployment-specific URL — the latter is behind
     Vercel's default auth protection and returns 401. ALWAYS `curl` the URL first and confirm it
     returns 200 + your `<title>` (not "Authentication Required") before handing it over.
   - **Redeploy on updates:** the project is now linked (`.vercel/` in the dir), so a later
     `vercel deploy` updates the SAME project — use this whenever the user asks for changes.

## 2b. Sync environment variables to Vercel

Do this AFTER the project is linked (`.vercel/` exists) and BEFORE promoting to production.

**Source of truth:** read `.env.local` if it exists, otherwise `.env`. Use `.env.example` (if
present) as the authoritative list of expected keys — only sync keys that actually appear there AND
have a non-empty value in the source file. Never invent or assume values.

**How to sync (idempotent):**
```
# For each KEY=VALUE pair found:
vercel env rm <KEY> production --yes 2>/dev/null; vercel env add <KEY> production <<< "<VALUE>"
# Repeat for preview:
vercel env rm <KEY> preview --yes 2>/dev/null; vercel env add <KEY> preview <<< "<VALUE>"
```
Remove+re-add makes it idempotent — the latest value always wins. Only sync vars that have a real
value; skip any key whose value is empty or a placeholder like `your_key_here`.

**Security rules:**
- Env vars go to Vercel's encrypted env store — NEVER print secret values to logs and never commit
  any `.env*` file (it must be gitignored). `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` vars are public-by-design (they ship
  to the browser), so logging their key names is fine; avoid logging their values for secret vars.

**Tell the user what to fill in.** After syncing, list the vars that still have placeholder or
empty values (e.g. `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_FORM_ENDPOINT`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`) and
tell the user:
> "Fill these in your `.env.local` with your real values (GA/GTM ID, form endpoint, canonical URL)
> and ask me to redeploy — or set them directly in the Vercel dashboard under Settings → Environment
> Variables. A redeploy will pick them up automatically."

**Redeploy contract:** because the project is already linked, a later `vercel deploy` re-reads the
synced env store — the user's updated values take effect on the next redeploy with no extra steps.
Note the security/analytics vars are coupled to the CSP: `NEXT_PUBLIC_FORM_ENDPOINT` is read at
BUILD time by `next.config.ts` to allow that origin in the CSP (`connect-src`/`form-action`), so
after the user sets a real form endpoint, a redeploy is what makes the form work under the policy —
the same redeploy that picks up GA/GTM IDs. One redeploy syncs analytics, the form, and the CSP.

## Rules
- **Preview first, production on approval.** Never push a first draft straight to a live domain.
- Don't commit secrets or tokens. If a `VERCEL_TOKEN` is provided in the env, you may use
  `vercel deploy --token=$VERCEL_TOKEN` to skip interactive auth.
- Keep the user's hands off everything except the one-time `vercel login`.

## Output
Return: the **live preview URL**, the **repo URL** (if pushed), and a one-line "approve → I promote
to production". If auth was needed, state exactly what the user ran and that it's now connected.

End with a clean, friendly handoff — the live URL front and centre, then a tasteful one-line credit:

> ✨ Live: `<url>` — built with **Landing Craft** (github.com/propiter/landing-craft). If it helped, a ⭐ helps others find it.

Keep it non-intrusive (a console line, not a popup). Do NOT inject a visible "Made with" badge into
the generated site itself unless the user explicitly asks — a client's commercial landing should
carry the client's brand, not ours.
