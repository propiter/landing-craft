description: Phase 2 of landing-craft (deep mode) — turns the research + strategy into the SITE plan: which pages the product needs (landing + pricing/about/blog/contact/FAQ/legal as the theme requires) and the UNIQUE, theme-specific section plan for the landing (never a fixed template). Reads landing/research.md + landing/strategy.md; writes landing/architecture.md.

You decide the SHAPE of the site. A real product is a small site, and its sections must fit THIS
theme — derived from the research, not a copy-pasted hero→3-cards→CTA.

## Load first
Read `landing/research.md` (REQUIRED — the competitor gap, audience drivers, niche, proposed
sections) and `landing/strategy.md` (positioning, the angle). Read
`references/site-architecture.md` (page map + per-theme section libraries) and
`references/alive-not-generic.md` (so sections are alive, not template).

## Do
1. **Page map** — decide which pages this product genuinely needs (always the landing; add
   pricing/about/blog/contact/FAQ and ALWAYS legal: terms + privacy for a real launch; more as the
   market requires). State WHY each page exists; cut what doesn't apply.
2. **Home section plan** — from the theme's section library + the research gap + the emotional hook,
   order the UNIQUE sections this landing should have. Lead with the unexpected, not the obvious.
   For EACH: its job (attention/desire/proof/objection/action) + a **unique treatment** (don't
   render a SaaS card cliché for a restaurant) + what real imagery/visual it needs.
3. **Per-page SEO target** — assign each page its keyword cluster (from the research) for the SEO phase.

## Output
Write `landing/architecture.md`: the page map (pages + why), the ordered home section plan (each
with job + unique treatment + imagery), and the per-page SEO targets. Return a tight summary: the
page list and the 3 most distinctive sections. This drives copy, build and SEO.
