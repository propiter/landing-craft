description: Bootstraps landing-craft for a project — detects the environment (framework, git, brand assets, tooling) and readiness so the deep pipeline runs informed and never fails mid-way. Checks Firecrawl, Vercel, gh, Next.js; creates the landing/ artifact dir; loads/creates the style profile. Writes landing/_init.md.

You set the stage so the pipeline never trips on a missing tool. Follow `references/_conventions.md`.

## Do (fast, factual — real checks, not guesses)
1. **Project** — is there an existing app? (`package.json` → Next.js / Vite / Astro / other; or
   none = greenfield). Detect the package manager (pnpm/npm/yarn/bun) and whether deps are installed.
2. **Repo & brand** — git repo? existing logo/brand/`design/` assets? an existing site to scrape?
3. **Tooling readiness** (so deploy + research work):
   - `gh auth status` → GitHub ready?
   - `vercel whoami` (install via `npm i -g vercel` if missing) → Vercel auth state.
   - Firecrawl reachable? Detect the URL across **multiple locations** — the API key is OPTIONAL
     (self-hosted Firecrawl often needs none; only the URL matters):
     1. Shell env `$FIRECRAWL_URL` (this is how OpenCode sees it — OpenCode inherits the shell env)
     2. Project `.env` / `.env.local` (grep for `FIRECRAWL_URL=`)
     3. `~/.claude/settings.json` → `.env.FIRECRAWL_URL` block (Claude Code only — OpenCode does
        NOT read this file, which is why the shell env above is the cross-tool source of truth)
     4. The shell profile (`~/.zshrc` / `~/.bashrc` / `~/.profile`) → `export FIRECRAWL_URL=` line
     If a URL is found, probe it: `curl -sS -m 8 -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' "$FIRECRAWL_URL"`;
     a 2xx/3xx/4xx response (i.e. the server answered) means **Ready**.
     `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` — check the same locations; if present use it; if absent that is fine,
     proceed without it.
     If NO URL is found anywhere → mark Firecrawl as **Optional / skipped** (research falls back to
     WebFetch/WebSearch). This is NOT a blocking "needs attention" warning — never block the pipeline.
   - **Playwright** (for asset rendering + the pre-deploy visual test): are browsers present? If
     not, note it'll auto-install on first use (`npx playwright install chromium`). `icotool` for favicons?
   - engram available? Node/pnpm present?
4. **Style profile** — `mem_search landing-craft/style-profile`; if absent, note the defaults
   (Next.js+Tailwind, animation `medium`, no hardcoded tokens).
5. **Bootstrap** — create `landing/` for artifacts. Do NOT scaffold the app yet (build phase owns that).

## Zero-debt
If a check reveals something fixable now (e.g. Vercel not installed → install it; `landing/` missing
→ create it), do it — don't just report it.

## Output
Write `landing/_init.md`: environment summary + a readiness table with THREE statuses — **✅ Ready**,
**⚠️ Needs-action** (a REQUIRED tool is missing/unauthed and would block or degrade output), and
**○ Optional** (a non-essential tool is absent but the pipeline fully covers the job another way).
Reserve ⚠️ for things that actually matter — e.g. **ImageMagick is NOT required** (Playwright +
icotool already generate every asset; Next.js/sharp handles optimization), so mark it **○ Optional**,
never ⚠️. Nothing genuinely optional should read as a problem. End with the ONE thing (if any) the
user must do once (e.g. `vercel login`). Return a 4-line summary so the orchestrator can start
informed. Never block the pipeline — report and proceed.
